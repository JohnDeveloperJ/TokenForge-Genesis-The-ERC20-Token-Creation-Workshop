# Master Mold ERC20 Token Factory

## Overview

The Master Mold ERC20 Token Factory is a smart contract system implemented on Ethereum that allows users to create their own ERC20-compliant tokens with custom parameters. This factory contract simplifies the process of token creation, making it accessible to users without in-depth knowledge of smart contract development.

The system provides features like:
- MEV front-running bot protection.
- 1% bag whale protection.
- 5% buy and sell tax fee distribution.
- Enhanced security features and much more.

## Features

- **Token Contract Creation**: Users can deploy their own ERC20 tokens with custom names, symbols, decimals, and initial supplies.
- **Anti-Front Running**: Utilizes techniques to prevent malicious MEV bots from frontrunning transactions.
- **Whale Protection**: Limits the maximum percentage of the total supply that can be transacted in a single transfer.
- **Taxation System**: Implements a taxation system on buys/sells that contributes to liquidity pools, buyback and burn mechanisms, and a marketing wallet.

## Contract Architecture

- `MasterMold.sol`: The factory contract responsible for deploying new ERC20 token contracts.
- `ERC20Token.sol`: A template for ERC20 tokens with additional features like taxation and protection mechanisms.

## Prerequisites

To interact with the Master Mold system, you will need:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Truffle Suite](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) or [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) for smart contract compilation and deployment.
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) or any Ethereum-compatible wallet for interaction with the Ethereum network.

## Setup and Deployment

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/master-mold-erc20-factory.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Compile the smart contracts:

    ```bash
    truffle compile
    ```

    or if you are using Hardhat:

    ```bash
    npx hardhat compile
    ```

4. Deploy the contracts to the Ethereum network:

    ```bash
    truffle migrate --network <your_network>
    ```

    or for Hardhat:

    ```bash
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <your_network>
    ```

    Replace `<your_network>` with the Ethereum network you wish to deploy to (e.g., `mainnet`, `ropsten`, `rinkeby`, etc.).

5. Verify the contract on Etherscan (optional):

    ```bash
    npx hardhat verify --network <your_network> DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
    ```

## How to Use

To create a new ERC20 token, call the `createToken` function on the deployed Master Mold contract with the desired parameters.

## Testing

Run the test suite using Truffle:

```bash
truffle test
```

or with Hardhat:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```
